# FAQ

There are 2 licenses for ChickareeDB. BSL covers our core and CCL (ChickareeDB Community License) 
which covers enterprise features. 

1. [BSL](bsl.md): The intent as we mentioned in our [blog post](https://vectorized.io/open-source) 
is to allow any use of the none enterprise features Redpanda unless you want to 
offer Redpanda as a service. The license will at some point in the future (change date) become Apache 2.

2. [CCL](ccl.md): ChickareeDB Community License - is intended to allow you to use enterprise features
that you pay for. 

We thank MariaDB and CockroachDB and Red Panda for pioneering the use of BSL for storage systems. 
It gave us a path to build an infrastructure company in the age of the hyperclouds.
